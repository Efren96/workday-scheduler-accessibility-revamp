# Workday Scheduler Application

## About Project 

This week we were given starter code that included the HTML and CSS files but needed a Java Script file in order to meet some of the acceptance criteria like allowing users to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am-5pm) and using dayjs to have the current date displayed on the applications header section.

## Steps I Took To Complete Challenge 

* The first thing i did was create a new repository on GitHub and copy it on to my local machine.

* Then went over the acceptance criteria to make a checklist of the things that needed to be done.

* I started updating the java script file by adding the current date to the page using jquery and dayjs to get the proper format.

* I then created my first function containing if statements comparing time sections to actual time to decide weather its past, present, or future, aka weather the section is going to me grey(past), red(present), or green(future).

* I then created another function for the save button so when the user saves their to do task, its saved in localStorage and stays on the application if its refreshed.

* I added comments to my java script and html and went over the acceptance criteria checklist to make sure everything was checked off.

* Finally, once i felt like the application met all the criteria, i pushed it to GitHub.
